 # Alarm Clock
NOTE
=========
These files have no license and can be used for anything, but I personally do not recommend using them as a reference for other projects.
I believe I gave too little information to attempt this yourself, and I only uploaded this to have a place where people can see it.

Most of the file is said to be in C, but I coded in C++. The C is due to large .WAV files.

If you would like to know more about this project, as I do not talk about it here, visit my site:
